Model Irrigation Vaucher Entry

Here's what it does: 
- last 30-50 entries initially visible on Voucher Entry page 
- all entries added today are selected by default, others are unchecked
- as entries are added, they are added to the top of the DataTable (sorted newest at the top / or voucher id descending)
- Voucher ID in the table is clickable (doubleclick) - which puts that voucher info into the form
- Settings page just saves the defaults 
- There is one more field  - the "mystery field" is always set to "3700" - no one knows what this is for - it should be in the "defaults / settings" and on the output.
- Simple htaccess / apache verification for folder access.
- all the checked data should be added to the file with the name - 18lYYYYMMDD (year,month, date, for example 18l20150310 if the date is Mar 10, 2015).
